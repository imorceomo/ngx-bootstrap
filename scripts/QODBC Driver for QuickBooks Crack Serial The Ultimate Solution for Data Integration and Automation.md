## Flight Dynamics and Performance
 
The flight dynamics and performance of the Majestic Q400 1.011 Pilot Edition are one of its strongest points. The Q400 uses a custom flight dynamics engine that bypasses the default P3Dv2 or FSX flight model and simulates the aerodynamics of the aircraft in real time. This results in a very realistic and responsive behavior of the Q400 in various flight conditions.
 
The Q400 also simulates the effects of wind gusts, turbulence, ground friction, propeller drag, engine torque, propeller wash,
