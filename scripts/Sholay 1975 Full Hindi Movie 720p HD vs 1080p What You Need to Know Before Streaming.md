Sholay is widely considered as one of the greatest films of Indian cinema and a landmark in Bollywood. It broke box office records and became the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time. It also received critical acclaim for its screenplay, direction, performances, music, cinematography, and editing[^2^]. Sholay has been influential in Indian popular culture and has spawned numerous sequels, remakes, and parodies.
 
If you are a fan of Sholay or want to watch it for the first time, you might be wondering which version to choose: 720p HD or 1080p. Both versions have their pros and cons, depending on your preferences and device. Here are some factors to consider:
 
- 720p HD stands for 720 pixels horizontal resolution and high definition. It has a lower resolution than 1080p but also a smaller file size and less bandwidth requirement. It is suitable for smaller screens or slower internet connections.
- 1080p stands for 1080 pixels horizontal resolution and progressive scan. It has a higher resolution than 720p but also a larger file size and more bandwidth requirement. It is suitable for larger screens or faster internet connections.
- The quality of the video also depends on the source material and the encoding process. Some 720p videos might look better than some 1080p videos if they are from a better source or encoded with more care.
- The difference between 720p and 1080p might not be noticeable to some viewers, especially if they are not watching closely or from a distance. However, some viewers might prefer the sharper details and smoother motion of 1080p over the softer edges and slight blurriness of 720p.

In conclusion, there is no definitive answer to which version of Sholay is better: 720p HD or 1080p. It depends on your personal preference, device, and internet speed. You can try both versions and see which one you like more. Either way, you will enjoy watching this classic Hindi movie in HD quality.

Sholay is not only a movie, but also a phenomenon. It has inspired generations of filmmakers, actors, and audiences with its memorable scenes, dialogues, and characters. Here are some interesting trivia about this iconic film that you might not know:

1. Sholay was originally planned to have a happy ending, with Jai surviving his injuries and reuniting with Veeru and Basanti. However, the censor board objected to the scene where Thakur kills Gabbar with his feet, saying that it violated the law and order. Ramesh Sippy had to reshoot the climax, where Jai dies and Thakur hands over Gabbar to the police[^1^].
2. Sholay was the first film to use the 70 mm format in India. It was also the first film to introduce stereophonic sound, which enhanced the impact of the background music and sound effects. The film's sound designer was Mangesh Desai, who also worked on films like Mughal-e-Azam and Mother India[^2^].
3. Sholay was influenced by various Hollywood and foreign films, especially the western genre. The film's plot was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), where a group of samurai are hired to protect a village from bandits. The train robbery sequence was inspired by Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), where a harmonica-playing gunman faces off against a ruthless killer[^1^].
4. Sholay was a huge gamble for Ramesh Sippy and his father G.P. Sippy, who produced the film. The film's budget was Rs. 3 crore, which was a record at that time. The film took more than two years to complete, with delays due to weather, technical issues, and reshoots. The film also faced problems with distributors, who were skeptical about its prospects[^2^].
5. Sholay was initially met with mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who found it too violent and lengthy. The film also faced competition from other releases like Deewaar and Jai Santoshi Maa. However, word-of-mouth publicity and repeat viewings soon made Sholay a blockbuster hit. The film ran for five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre, setting a record for the longest theatrical run in India[^2^].
6. Sholay won only one Filmfare award out of the nine nominations it received. The award went to M.S. Shinde for best editing. The film lost out to Deewaar in most of the categories, including best film, best director, best actor, best supporting actor, and best dialogue[^2^]. However, Sholay later received several retrospective awards and honors, such as the Filmfare 50 years Jubilee Award in 2005.
7. Sholay made stars out of its cast members, especially Amjad Khan, who played Gabbar Singh. Khan was an unknown actor before Sholay, and he almost lost the role because his voice was considered too weak for a villain. He worked hard on his dialogue delivery and mannerisms, creating one of the most iconic characters in Indian cinema[^1^]. His dialogues like \"Kitne aadmi the?\" and \"Tera kya hoga Kalia?\" became part of popular culture.
8. Sholay also launched the careers of several supporting actors and technicians who worked on the film. Mac Mohan, who played Sambha, became famous for his single line \"Poore pachaas hazaar.\" Asrani, who played the jailor, became known for his comic timing and Hitler parody. Sachin Pilgaonkar, who played Ahmed, won a car as a reward from Ramesh Sippy for his performance[^2^]. R.D. Burman composed one of his best soundtracks for Sholay, featuring songs like \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" and \"Yeh Dosti.\"
9. Sholay had a lasting impact on Indian cinema and popular culture. It established the masala genre of films that combined action, comedy, romance, drama, and music. It also popularized the buddy film genre that featured two male leads as friends or partners. It influenced several films that paid homage or spoofed its scenes and characters[^1^]. It also spawned several sequels, remakes, and spin-offs in different
