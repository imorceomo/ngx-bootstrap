The collection features 42 unique pieces of voxel art, each with its own name and description. Some of the pieces are inspired by popular culture, such as "The Matrix", "Star Wars" and "Minecraft". Others are abstract, surreal or whimsical, such as "Voxel City", "Rainbow Spiral" and "Voxicorn". The collection also includes some audio-visual pieces that use sound and animation to enhance the voxel experience, such as "Voxygen Music" and "Voxel Fireworks".
 
Voxygen C4d Plugin 42 is available on OpenSea, a marketplace for digital collectibles. Each piece is a non-fungible token (NFT) that can be bought, sold or traded on the platform. The collection is one of the first to use voxel art as a form of NFT art, and aims to attract both voxel enthusiasts and NFT collectors. The collection also demonstrates the potential of Voxygen as a tool for creating voxel art for various purposes and platforms.

Voxel art is a form of digital art that uses voxels, or 3D pixels, to create 3D models and scenes. Voxel art is similar to pixel art, but with an added dimension of depth. Voxel art can be used for various purposes, such as video games, animation, illustration, sculpture and architecture. Voxel art can also be printed in 3D or displayed in virtual reality.
 
There are many applications and tools that can be used to create voxel art, such as MagicaVoxel, Qubicle, Goxel, Voxatron and Minecraft. Some of these tools are free and open source, while others are paid and proprietary. Some of these tools are designed for beginners, while others are more advanced and professional. Some of these tools have specific features and functions, such as lighting, rendering, animation and scripting.
 
Voxel art has a distinctive style and aesthetic that can range from retro to realistic. Voxel art can be influenced by various genres and cultures, such as sci-fi, fantasy, horror, anime and pixel art. Voxel art can also be original and innovative, creating new worlds and characters with voxels. Some examples of voxel art are "Crossy Road", "Fez", "Land's End", "Monument Valley" and "Voxatron".

Some of the benefits of voxel art are:
 
- Voxel art is easy to start with, as it does not require complex modeling skills or tools. Anyone can create voxel art with a simple software and a mouse or keyboard.
- Voxel art is versatile and flexible, as it can be used for various purposes and platforms, such as video games, animation, illustration, sculpture, architecture, virtual reality and 3D printing.
- Voxel art is expressive and creative, as it allows artists to experiment with different styles, colors and themes. Voxel art can also be influenced by various genres and cultures, or be original and innovative.
- Voxel art is realistic and accurate, as it mimics the real world in terms of particles and volume. Voxel art can also simulate the real world behavior of complex objects and materials.

Some of the challenges of voxel art are:

- Voxel art is resource-intensive and demanding, as it requires a lot of memory and processing power to render high-resolution voxel models and scenes. Voxel art can also take a long time to load and export.
- Voxel art is limited and constrained, as it depends on the availability and compatibility of software and hardware. Voxel art can also suffer from aliasing and jagged edges due to the cubic nature of voxels.
- Voxel art is repetitive and tedious, as it involves a lot of manual work and editing. Voxel art can also be hard to modify or animate due to the lack of smooth curves and surfaces.
- Voxel art is niche and obscure, as it is not widely adopted or recognized by the mainstream art community. Voxel art can also be hard to monetize or protect due to the lack of legal frameworks and standards.
