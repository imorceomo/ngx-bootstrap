Now that you have applied some distortion to your sound, you can use the other modules in Trash 2 to further shape and enhance it. Here are some tips and tricks for using each module:
 
- **Filter 1 and Filter 2**: These modules let you apply various filters to your sound, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, comb and more. You can also use the filter as a vowel shaper or a talkbox effect. You can adjust the frequency, resonance, gain and slope of each filter, as well as the filter type and mode. You can also modulate the filter cutoff with an LFO or an envelope follower for dynamic effects. For example, you can use a low-pass filter with an envelope follower to create a wah-wah effect on your bass sequence.
- **Convolve**: This module lets you apply realistic or creative impulses to your sound. You can choose from over 100 impulses, including amps, cabinets, objects, animals, mouth shapes and more. You can also load your own impulses or mix and match different ones. You can adjust the mix, width, gain and phase of each impulse, as well as the impulse type and mode. You can also modulate the impulse selection with an LFO or an envelope follower for dynamic effects. For example, you can use a cabinet impulse to add some warmth and character to your bass sequence.
- **Dynamics**: This module lets you control the volume and compression of your sound. You can adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, release and gain of each band, as well as the knee shape and mode. You can also use the dynamics as a gate or an expander for noise reduction or transient enhancement. You can also modulate the threshold with an LFO or an envelope follower for dynamic effects. For example, you can use a gate to remove unwanted noise from your bass sequence.
- **Delay**: This module lets you add echo and feedback effects to your sound. You can adjust the delay time, feedback, mix and width of each band, as well as the delay type and mode. You can also use the delay as a chorus or a flanger for modulation effects. You can also modulate the delay time with an LFO or an envelope follower for dynamic effects. For example, you can use a flanger to add some movement and depth to your bass sequence.

With these tips and tricks, you can explore the endless possibilities of iZotope Trash 2 and create unique and exciting sounds for your music production. Trash 2 is not only a distortion plug-in, but also a creative sound design tool that can help you achieve any sonic goal.
