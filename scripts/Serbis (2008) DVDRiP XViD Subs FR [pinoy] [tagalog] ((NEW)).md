The film follows the lives of a family who runs a run-down movie theater that shows pornographic films. The theater is also a place where prostitutes and gay hustlers offer their services to the patrons. The family has to deal with various problems such as infidelity, debt, legal issues and sexual abuse.
 
Serbis is known for its explicit scenes of nudity and sex, as well as its gritty depiction of the urban poor in the Philippines. The film received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom praised its realism and social commentary, while others criticized its lack of plot and coherence. The film also sparked controversy for its portrayal of homosexuality and prostitution, which some viewers found offensive and immoral.

Serbis is not a conventional narrative film, but rather a slice of life that explores the themes of family, sexuality, morality and survival. The film does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of the characters' lives, such as poverty, violence, corruption and disease. The film also challenges the viewers' expectations and prejudices by presenting complex and flawed characters who are neither heroes nor villains.
 
The film has been praised for its cinematography, editing and sound design, which create a vivid and immersive atmosphere. The film uses handheld cameras, natural lighting and ambient sounds to capture the chaotic and claustrophobic environment of the theater. The film also employs long takes, jump cuts and overlapping dialogue to create a sense of realism and spontaneity. The film's soundtrack consists of songs from Filipino pop culture, which contrast with the bleakness of the film's setting.
